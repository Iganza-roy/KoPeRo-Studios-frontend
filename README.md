<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Features of The Project
- **User and Crew Profiles:** Users and crew members have distinct profiles, each with tailored navigation and features.
- **Service Selection and Booking:** Clients can view available services and book appointments with professionals, filtering by date and availability.
- **Role-Based Navigation:** Custom dashboards and navigation bars for crew and users.
- **Authentication:** Users and crew members can log in and register with unique role-based access, using token-based authentication.
- **Appointment Management:** Both clients and crew members can manage appointments with status tracking, such as booked or completed.
- **Profile and Image Upload:** Users can update profile pictures directly in the PUT request.

### Project Structure
The project is organized into two main directories:

[![React][React.js]][React-url] 
- **Frontend:** Built with React, using Vite as the bundler.
- **Backend:** Developed with Django, handling API endpoints, authentication, and data management for bookings and profiles. 

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

## Installation
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed for frontend setup, and Python for backend setup. Clone both repositories for a complete setup.

#### 1. Clone the Repositories
Clone this repository and the backend server repository.
```sh
git clone <https://github.com/omollpeter/KoPeRo-Studios-Frontend/edit/main/README.md>
git clone <https://github.com/omollpeter/kopero-studios-server>
```

#### 2. Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory.
   ```sh
   cd KoPeRo-Studios-Frontend
   ```
2, Install Dependancies
```sh
npm install
```
3. Run the development server.
```sh
   npm run dev
```

#### 3. Backend Setup
For backend setup and API details, please refer to the backend server repository link provided here: [kopero backend Repo](https://github.com/omollpeter/kopero-studios-server). Follow the instructions in the backend repository README for database migrations, environment configurations, and server startup.

### Running the Project
1. Ensure both frontend and backend servers are running. The frontend will likely run on localhost:5173 (default for Vite), while the Django backend server should run on  ```localhost:8000```.
2. To connect the frontend to the backend, ensure that CORS settings in Django are configured to allow requests from ```http://localhost:5173```.
3. Update any environment variables as needed for your setup.

### API and Backend Integration
The Django backend provides RESTful endpoints for user registration, authentication, profile management, service listings, and booking management.
Endpoints:
- User and Crew Authentication: /api/v1/auth/
- Profile Management: /api/v1/profile/
- Service Listings: /api/v1/services/
- Bookings: /api/v1/bookings/
For further API details and request examples, refer to the backend documentation in [kopero backend Repo](https://github.com/Iganza-roy/kopero-studios-server).

## Usage
1. **Register/Login** as a user or crew member.
2. **Browse Services:** Users can view the list of services offered by photographers and videographers.
3. **Book an Appointment:** Select an available crew member, choose a service, and complete the booking process.
4. **Manage Appointments:** Track status, reschedule, or cancel appointments through the user or crew dashboard.


## Dependencies
The project relies on several key packages:

- **React:** Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
- **Vite:** Bundler for fast project setup and optimized builds.
- **Django:** Backend framework for handling API requests, user management, and data persistence.
- **Axios:** For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **JWT-Decode:** For token-based authentication.
- **Toast Notifications:** Used for alerting users with messages and errors.
- Other packages and dependencies are listed in the ```package.json``` files in their respective repositories.
